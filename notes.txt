Can anyone tell me what a library is?
A library is a collection of precompiled routines that a program can use which someonehas already developed. Lazy programmers like us will make use of such code for different purposes.

Today we will call such a library, physics engine. The physics engine is a library that allows falling and sliding boxes, bouncing balls, chains etc.

To use the physics engine, we will use three objects created in matter.js library -> World, Engine and Bodies.
● World is used to create the physical world and add objects to it.
● The Engine module provides different methods and properties that allow you to control the behavior of different engines.
● The Bodies module contains different methods to help you create rigid bodies with common shapes like a circle, rectangle or trapezium. Since these objects are a part of the Matter library, they are referenced as Matter.World, Matter.Engine and Matter.Bodies.

Let's rename them as World, Engine and Bodies so that it is easy to write and read our code. This is called namespacing in programming.

In physics, the bounciness of an object is called "restitution". We can change the restitution of an object and create the bounciness effect.


But rotate() and translate() functions change the entire game space's angle and translation. Every new object willbe drawn at this new angle and translation.
To prevent this from happening , we can store the new translation and rotation setting and then revert back to the old setting when the object is drawn.


This is done using push() and pop().
● push(): captures the new setting.

● pop(): reverts to the old setting.

● translate(): to change the 0 of the axis to a given x and y position.
