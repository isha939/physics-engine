Can anyone tell me what a library is?
A library is a collection of precompiled routines that a program can use which someonehas already developed. Lazy programmers like us will make use of such code for different purposes.

Today we will call such a library, physics engine. The physics engine is a library that allows falling and sliding boxes, bouncing balls, chains etc.

To use the physics engine, we will use three objects created in matter.js library -> World, Engine and Bodies.
● World is used to create the physical world and add objects to it.
● The Engine module provides different methods and properties that allow you to control the behavior of different engines.
● The Bodies module contains different methods to help you create rigid bodies with common shapes like a circle, rectangle or trapezium. Since these objects are a part of the Matter library, they are referenced as Matter.World, Matter.Engine and Matter.Bodies.

Let's rename them as World, Engine and Bodies so that it is easy to write and read our code. This is called namespacing in
programming.
